        "description": "<p><em>Abstract</em>&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Often the work of a software developer is to write down complicated things in an unambiguous way. In this talk I&#39;d like to remind you about mathematical modelling - writing down mathematical relations that approximate a situation - and give a real story about how I should have started with a pencil rather than a keyboard.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;<em>About Me</em>&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;<a href=\"http://jonnyarnold.uk/\">Jonny Arnold</a> has been a software developer professionally for 5 years and  as an amateur for another 5. Having worked with C# and Ruby in the past, Jonny is now using JavaScript to build an online mortgage broker at <a href=\"http://www.trussle.com/\">Trussle</a>.</p>\n",
