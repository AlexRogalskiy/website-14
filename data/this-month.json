By using React hooks, Context and other open source projects you can easily build your own useful library.</p>\n<p>I wanted first class TypeScript support, immutable data, zero boilerplate and hassle free wiring. I built it in a few dozen lines of code: <a href=\"https://github.com/jamesporter/immutable-context\">Immutable Context</a>.</p>\n<p>I&#39;ll demo how to use it via a <a href=\"https://codesandbox.io/s/intelligent-kowalevski-6evy9?fontsize=14\">Code Sandbox demo</a>, how it works under the hood and then look at some lessons learned, with suggestions on how to build your own state management library in 2019.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about\">About</h2>\n<p>I&#39;m a polyglot developer and data scientist. I&#39;ve built lots of apps, for example this <a href=\"https://isometrically.amimetic.co.uk\">iPhone app for Isometric graphics</a>.
