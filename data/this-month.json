        "description": "<p>REST is recognized as the &quot;good practice&quot; in terms of web APIs, but can quickly become a hassle as your application grows and evolves.&#13;&#10;QraphQL is a new paradigm, allowing developers to request deeply nested information in a single call, without cluttering the response with unneeded fields.&#13;&#10;In this talk, I will show how GraphQL overcomes the rest limitations to send only the information a caller wants, without changing anything on your backend.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;I am currently working at Theodo (<a href=\"http://www.theodo.co.uk/\">http://www.theodo.co.uk/</a>) and have been for the past 18 months, as a fullstack developer.</p>\n",
