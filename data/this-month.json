(If you missed it - check <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7gCKAfrlkAk&amp;list=PLam_80-FY3vTo_2mlVajPvnqWqUrECJeK\">all last month&#39;s videos here</a>)</p>\n<p>This month it&#39;s your turn. For 3-8 minutes, the mic is yours. Add your name and topic as a <a href=\"https://github.com/lnug/speakers/issues/119\">comment in this issue</a>. Or turn up on the night and we will try fit you in... </p>\n<p>Also, as usual: community announcements, open source projects, job hunters and offers will have a chance on the mic. </p>\n",
