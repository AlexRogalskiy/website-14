        "title": "Managing cloud resources in a distributed and fault-tolerant manner with EVRYTHNG&rsquo;s resource manager",
        "description": "<p>At <a href=\"http://evrythng.com/\">EVRYTHNG</a> we had to a build a number of Node.js applications that required managing multiple resources in a distributed environment. For example, handling real-time connections to other clouds such as Nest and Honeywell and sending notifications to <a href=\"https://ifttt.com/\">IFTTT</a> applets. What if there was a library that handled the allocation and distribution of these resources so developers could focus on the core business logic of their application?</p>\n<p>The EVRYTHNG distributed resource manager is a Node.js library that solves this problem. Developers don&rsquo;t need to worry about maintaining real-time connections when new nodes are added to the system or if one of them goes down.</p>\n<p>In this talk I would demonstrate the resource manager so attendees will see what problems it solves for us at EVRYTHNG. In addition, they will gain an understanding of how we use Node.js at our company and how it helps us scale. Please note that this library is not currently open source but it should be in the next 1-2 months.</p>\n<p>I work as a Technical Lead for EVRYTHNG who provide an IoT platform for businesses around the world. It&rsquo;s my role to decide on the architecture for various parts of the platform and how we will build these components using Node.js. I&rsquo;ve been programming in Node for five years.</p>\n",
