        "description": "<p>This talk follows on from @cullophid&#39;s session and seeks to build on those foundations with larger abstractions that can help developers to avoid common pitfalls when writing JavaScript such as null references (<code>Maybe</code>s), uncaught exceptions (<code>Either</code>s) and asynchronous control flow (<code>Future</code>s). These abstractions help to encapsulate uncertainty allowing us to code the happy path whilst ultimately enforcing the handling of error conditions and as the data types all share a common interface it allows us to compose them in predictable ways.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Stefano Vozza is a tech lead at Trinity Mirror and has a keen interest in functional programming, DevOps and continuous delivery. He is a main contributor to several open source Javascript FP libraries such as <a href=\"https://github.com/sanctuary-js/sanctuary\">Sanctuary</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/cullophid/date-fp\">date-fp</a> and <a href=\"https://github.com/caolan/highland\">Highland</a>. &#13;&#10;</p>\n",

James shows us how all the various&#13;&#10;parts of functional programming comes together to create safe efficient code&#13;&#10;that is easily readable and extendable. &#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;James chow has been a software contractor for over 10 years.
