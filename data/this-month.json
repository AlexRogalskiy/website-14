        "description": "<p>I&rsquo;ve alway been keen to provide a good offline experience for the LNUG website. We already use AppCache with the help of <a href=\"https://github.com/gr2m/appcache-nanny\">app-cache-nanny</a> but with its upcoming <a href=\"https://www.fxsitecompat.com/en-CA/docs/2015/application-cache-api-has-been-deprecated/\">depreciation</a> I&rsquo;ve been investigating how service workers might improve the experience as well as as ensuring the site continues to work when you&rsquo;re offline.</p>\n<p>In this talk I will discuss how the LNUG websites uses appCache and services workers, the things I&rsquo;ve learned along the way and what we can still improve the experience. </p>\n<p>I&#39;m a remote Javascript engineer, part time conference organiser and my opinions can often be found on twitter: <a href=\"twitter.com/simonmcmanus\">@simonmcmanus</a>. </p>\n",
