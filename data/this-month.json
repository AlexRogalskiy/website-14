This talk mainly outlines lessons learned and optimisations which will hopefully help you get quicker feedback from your CI pipeline and make your deployments run quicker.&#10;[A bit about you, e.g. current job, twitter handle, etc.]&#10;Although I have more experience in the back end side of things, I strive to be a full stack developer. I like working on well tested codebases with a well oiled CI pipeline</p>\n",
