        "description": "<p>Cloud computing services such as AWS, Azure and Google Compute have rapidly changed how we think and feel about our infrastructure. DevOps deployment is no longer copy-pasting a zip folder full of code onto a physical machine&#39;s network drive - and nothing is pushing the engine of change more than Serverless.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Serverless allows us to create event driven node micro-services with absolute ease, perfectly fitting into continuous integration / continuous deployment workflows. It boasts a wide range of plugins, and more importantly, allows us to effortlessly scale any number of stages to the nth degree.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Is Serverless for you? Quite probably! Lets find out.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Marcel (@marcelcutts) is a shifty vagabond type often found near laptops, currently belonging to the street gang known as Red Badger. Over his ten or so years in software he has worked on everything from scientific Fortran to the most hipster React code and will be your personal best friend forever should you feed him a BLT.</p>\n",

        "description": "<p><em>Abstract</em>&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Often the work of a software developer is to write down complicated things in an unambiguous way. In this talk I&#39;d like to remind you about mathematical modelling - writing down mathematical relations that approximate a situation - and give a real story about how I should have started with a pencil rather than a keyboard.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;<em>About Me</em>&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;<a href=\"http://jonnyarnold.uk/\">Jonny Arnold</a> has been a software developer professionally for 5 years and  as an amateur for another 5. Having worked with C# and Ruby in the past, Jonny is now using JavaScript to build an online mortgage broker at <a href=\"http://www.trussle.com/\">Trussle</a>.</p>\n",
