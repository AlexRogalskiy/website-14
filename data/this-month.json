        "description": "<h2 id=\"abstract\">Abstract</h2>\n<p>A look at the mechanisms inside web bundlers e.g Webpack.</p>\n<p>Starting with why they are still useful.&#10;Then how to build a small compiler, akin to Webpack. There are many interesting topics in a very small space here.&#10;Next how to use the output of our compiler with an application.&#10;Finishing with all the additional parts Webpack does which ours doesn&#39;t, hopefully with some idea on how those could be done.</p>\n<p>The talk should take around 30 (to 40) minutes including questions, that&#39;s roughly how long it took when I performed it at work.</p>\n<h2 id=\"about-me\">About me</h2>\n<p>I&#39;m a senior developer at Nested with over 10 years experience. We do dev team talks every week and I have taken a couple, usually on the &quot;under-the-hood of&quot; theme. I was previously at the BBC.</p>\n<p>My medium page is <a href=\"https://medium.com/@tabu_craig\">https://medium.com/@tabu_craig</a>, I enjoy blogging.</p>\n<p>Look forward to hearing all your thoughts.&#10;Thanks, Craig</p>\n",
