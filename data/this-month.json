Whilst the initial learning curve can be steep, it can ultimately make your development and deployment cycles much faster.</p>\n<p>In this talk, I will show you how to deploy a simple front- and back-end application using Docker, and show how much faster it is than the traditional, more manual approach.</p>\n<h2 id=\"resources\">Resources</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>You can try out the code yourself using the repository on <a href=\"https://github.com/d4nyll/docker-demo\">GitHub</a></li>\n<li>A variation of the presentation is also available on <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1ELRYLJI2Lgqk0zK0qQnVIYeZA2Nc0IG8jRaYRFr_TTM/\">Google Slides</a></li>\n<li>A recording of the talk is available on <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N5WKMVF_qlw\">YouTube</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2 id=\"about-me\">About Me</h2>\n<p>I am a JavaScript developer at <a href=\"https://www.nexmo.com/\">Nexmo</a>.
