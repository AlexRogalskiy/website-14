But what if we all had our own servers with our own applications running on them holding our data which we control? </p>\n<p>Is that doable today, using existing cloud services and node.js? What does it take? How easy is it?</p>\n<p>For the past few years, I&#39;ve been running my personal node.js-based server on AWS, Google Cloud, Openshift and Heroku, using mlabs and Mongo, as well as Dropbox!</p>\n<p>So I&#39;ll talk about what it takes for a non-techie (or at least a newbie) to set up a node.js server using each of those environments - the pluses and minuses of each ... and why doing this would be a good thing in general.</p>\n<p>About me:&#10;I am clean tech entrepreneur (@zemenergy.com) and VC executive (@top-funds.com).

We&#39;ll also explore how to handle things like seeding the database for the API before running tests, how to select elements in the DOM via Cucumber step definitions, and how to do this in a nice fashion using Node 8&#39;s async/await feature. </p>\n<p>My name is Paul Jensen, I&#39;m the author of Manning&#39;s Cross Platform Desktop Applications, and I&#39;m the Lead Innovation Engineer at Starcount.
