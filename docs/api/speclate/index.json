What challenges did we meet while writing it? How do you maintain, develop for, and test a system with extremely high availability on such a scale? It&#39;s a bit like juggling twenty fragile glass balls while riding a bicycle. Nevertheless, it&#39;s a surprisingly reliable way of delivering the best user experience, and pizza, to our users.</p>\n<p><strong>More info</strong>&#10;I&#39;ll introduce our (complex) infrastructure and will talk a bit more about challenges we have faced and how we solved them.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Splitting logic into microservices; changes made into several microservices at once &amp; deployment.</li>\n<li>Testing our huge products API; running over 20000 unit tests on one microservice, we need to micro-optimise.</li>\n<li>Making sure it actually works; a system of logging, monitoring, and support</li>\n</ol>\n<p>I believe Pizza Hut will be also happy to sponsor the event and deliver some free pizza ;)</p>\n<p><strong>About me</strong>&#10;I&#39;m a software engineer at Pizza Hut (contractor), speaker, node and react developer.
