Its key strengths are its lightweight syntax and its simple data model, which have helped propel it to be the dominant payload format in RESTful web services.</p>\n<p>A lightweight data format deserves a lightweight query and transformation technology that is accessible to non-programmers.  <a href=\"http://jsonata.org\">JSONata</a> provides that in an open-source module that can be embedded in a web page or used in a node.js app.  Designed with the principle that queries should be simple to write, JSONata has a very shallow learning curve. Yet sophisticated expressions can be quickly mastered by combining the simple navigation syntax with a rich set of operators and functions for extracting, manipulating and aggregating JSON data. </p>\n<p>This session will introduce you to JSONata and show you how to find buried treasure in your JSON data.</p>\n<p>Andrew Coleman is a senior software engineer at IBM specialising in data transformation and application integration.
