These abstractions help to encapsulate uncertainty allowing us to code the happy path whilst ultimately enforcing the handling of error conditions and as the data types all share a common interface it allows us to compose them in predictable ways.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Stefano Vozza is a tech lead at Trinity Mirror and has a keen interest in functional programming, DevOps and continuous delivery.
