In this talk I&#39;d like to remind you about mathematical modelling - writing down mathematical relations that approximate a situation - and give a real story about how I should have started with a pencil rather than a keyboard.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;<em>About Me</em>&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;<a href=\"http://jonnyarnold.uk/\">Jonny Arnold</a> has been a software developer professionally for 5 years and  as an amateur for another 5.

It boasts a wide range of plugins, and more importantly, allows us to effortlessly scale any number of stages to the nth degree.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Is Serverless for you? Quite probably! Lets find out.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;Marcel (@marcelcutts) is a shifty vagabond type often found near laptops, currently belonging to the street gang known as Red Badger. Over his ten or so years in software he has worked on everything from scientific Fortran to the most hipster React code and will be your personal best friend forever should you feed him a BLT.</p>\n",
