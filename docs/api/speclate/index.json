In this talk, we will dive deep into the inner workings of Javascript inheritance and see the beauty of prototypical inheritance and the prototype chain. While this is a classic talk, it is particularly relevant to the current debate in the React community over the use of fat arrow vs pre-bounded methods.&#10;<a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/thanpolas/classical-inheritance-in-javascript\">Talk slides</a></p>\n<p>Github: <a href=\"https://github.com/thanpolas\">thanpolas</a>, Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/thanpolas\">@thanpolas</a>, <a href=\"http://www.linkedin.com/in/thanpolas\">LinkedIn</a>, <a href=\"http://thanpol.as\">website</a></p>\n",

In this talk I&#39;ll be sharing how we&#39;re using Node.js throughout our stack, some of the key projects we&#39;ve built and the problems they solve, and how to really make the most out of Node.js to build an incredibly powerful engineering experience. </p>\n<p>I&#39;m a software engineer in the tech-foundations pod at <a href=\"http://join.holidayextras.co.uk/\">Holiday Extras</a> with a remit to improve the efficiency of our engineering team.
