Every month we all discover new things worth sharing and explaining about our uses of JavaScript and node.js. </p>\n<p>In this session we will open the mic for some short-burst, quick-fire presentations. Maximum 8 minutes to talk about whatever is getting you thinking and acting. To get on the lineup - add your name, topic and any further info in the comments on <a href=\"https://github.com/lnug/speakers/issues/116\">this issue</a>. </p>\n",
