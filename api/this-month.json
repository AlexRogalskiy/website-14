Unexpected itself is an open project is supported by a small but growing community. MY goal would be to give a basic introduction to Unexpected assertion syntax, some elements of it&#39;s extension API and combine those with an introduction to the functionality in unexptected-mitm.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;My name is Alex J Burke, I currently work as the Lead Platform Developer at a small company in London.
