        "description": "<p>With Makers Academy currently hosting LNUG I thought it might be a great chance to give a talk to cover a few things about it including:&#13;&#10;a) what a bootcamp is, &#13;&#10;b) what they teach, &#13;&#10;c) what is actually meant by the concept of &#39;learning to code in 12 weeks&#39;,&#13;&#10;d) what it feels like as a student to push yourself to go from very little coding capacity at the start to being able to write, test and deploy applications 3/4 months later,&#13;&#10;e) the contrast between CS and bootcamp style education and why there is such a demand for alternate education sources in the current market&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;I would be very interested in giving a talk of how Makers Academy has shaped my transition from a very different career path into a junior developer passionate about what I do. The talk would be rather technology agnostic, although node is one of the technologies I have had the pleasure of working with (and had to get to grips with very rapidly during a craft-a-thon), it would be much more based around trying to let people know about the trials and tribulations of the Makers Academy student journey.&#13;&#10;&#13;&#10;I&#39;m Michael, a junior developer who&#39;s just finished here at Makers&#13;&#10;You can learn a little more about me at <a href=\"http://www.michaellennox.me/blog/\">michaellennox.me/blog</a></p>\n",
